Neural networks in Java

Note from the far future: This implementation optimizes the weights by looping over all weights, adjusting them up and down by a small amount, and then choosing the new value with the lowest loss. This is way less efficient than backpropagation, but at this point I didn't fully get how that worked.

### Features:

- Matrix calculations
- Fully Connected Layers
- Training with Optimizers
- (Experimental) Multithreading
- Batches
- Some examples
- Expandable structure allows for own Layers/Activation functions/...
